Hello,

I have a question similar to David Paton Diaz's : At the submission page of the course project for the "Regression models" class, I uploaded my submission, but the assigment does not appear to be completed: the icon does not turn green or anything. It seems that I only recorded a draft, but not submitted it. (there is no submission button)

Should I do something ? has my work been submitted?

Thank you in advance.
